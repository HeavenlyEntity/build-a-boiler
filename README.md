# Build-a-Boiler â€” Discovery Engine (Phase 1)

ðŸš€ AI-powered boilerplate discovery engine. Find the perfect starter template for your next project from curated GitHub repos and across the web.

## Overview

Build-a-Boiler Discovery Engine helps developers find the ideal boilerplate for their projects by:
- Selecting their desired tech stack (Frontend, Backend, ORM, Auth, Payments)
- Describing what they're building
- Getting AI-curated results with confidence scores and summaries

## Features

âœ… **Tech Stack Selection** - Dropdowns for Frontend, Backend, ORM, Auth, and Payment providers
âœ… **AI Analysis** - Claude AI analyzes each boilerplate for relevance and quality
âœ… **Multiple Sources** - Searches both GitHub (via Sim Studio) and the web (via Firecrawl)
âœ… **Confidence Scoring** - Each result includes an AI-generated confidence score (1-100)
âœ… **Smart Summaries** - Get concise descriptions of what each boilerplate includes
